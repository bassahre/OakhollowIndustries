Welcome to OakHollow! 

**About Me:**

My name is Ahren and I'm currently a Data Analytics student at Sierra College. I use computers on a daily basis for work and for fun. I'm taking these classes as a bucket list item; I've always enjoyed learning and love the opportunity to share with my Nieces and Nephews that you're never too old to learn new skills. I do not find programming very intuitive and while I really do enjoy the content I often feel lost; I know many of the folks in this class have a lot of programing language experience already so I'm hopeful to learn from them as well. 

The most important things in my life are:
- My Friends & Family
- My Dogs 

I currently work in HR within a Recruiting group; I have a passion for helping folks find a fulfilling career. I LOVE to camp and my favorite holiday is _Halloween!_
